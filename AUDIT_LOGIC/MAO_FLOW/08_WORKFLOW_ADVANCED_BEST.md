## 8. Reviewing Advanced Workflow Best Practices 

### Core Objectives 

  - Show which workflows are built into Mao 
  - How to identify when to use other workflow tactics 
  - Advanced practices and leaving open-ended workflow phases 

### Core Types of Agentic Workflows 

* **The orchestrator-workers workflow**

  - A workflow that we *always* are using because Mao is an orchestrator 
    - Complex tasks when subtasks are unpredictable, like in coding or search 
    - Unlike standard parallelization, subtasks are not pre-defined 

  - One of our *priority* workflows to use frequently involves having Mao review the results from an agent 
    - The actual workflow to be executed will have a missing phase 
    - When the agent is complete, they call Mao to hand in deliverables 
    - Mao reviews the work and decides the next steps, even having the work redone if necessary 

  - Not just helpful for *creative tasks*
    - If an agent is doing *research*, they often will not know when to stop 
    - Mao can review the results, provide more guidance, what else to research, etc. 

* **The evaluator-optimizer workflow** 

  - Not defaulted into every workflow, but extremely important when accuracy is critical 
    - *Eliminates likelihood of hallucinated errors*  
    - Analogous to the iterative writing process a human writer might go through when producing a polished document
  - One agent completes a task, then another agent reviews and provides feedback that is implemented by themselves or another agent 
  - It is best to use agents rather than have Mao stand in as the optimizer on the regular 

* **The prompt chaining workflow**

  - Almost always implemented when possible 
    - *This helps break down the context window necessary for the task* 
    - Remember that context is as important if not more important than the prompt 
  - Great for generating marketing copy, writing outlines that become documents, etc. 

* **The routing workflow** 

  - We do this naturally when carefully deciding what model to use 
    - *This happens for every task* 
  - It is also part of our process when we write prompts 
    - They are always highly detailed 
    - Written specifically and uniquely for each task and model 

* **The parallelization workflow**

  - Our new favorite, where we task agents to work on different projects, or the same project in different ways, as the same time as each other 
    - *This cuts down on time needed* 
    - But also has other helpful, general, use-cases 
    - *Sectioning* is helpful when you need multiple things from the same content 
      - For example, have one agent answer questions from customers 
      - While another agent reviews  the questions for inappropriate content 
    - *Voting* is also great for getting multiple perspectives 
      - For example, each agent may review content using a different prompt 
      - Each agent looks for different aspects creating a more comprehensive result 

### Essentials & Best Practices 

* **Clearly define necessary tools** 

  - It is default that Mao always defines what tool is for what  
    - Mao creates *code snippets* that work like an actual button 
    - This eliminates the need for using different SDKs across different models or providers 
    - This doubles as a way to ensure that necessary tools are always clearly defined 
  - It will become *more and more important as more and more tools are added* 
    - We could have hundreds one day 
    - Diversity across app instances will be vast based on user needs 

* **Self-evaluation of work** 

  - Not built in by design but always helpful 
    - This is much *like using sequential thinking or chain of thought* 
    - Simply: *Review your work before you hand it in for Mao to review* 
    - While it is simple, it must be explicitly stated for Agents to do it 
    - Remember, without this, Agents are essentially just *putting out a constant stream of consciousness* 

### What a Great Workflow Looks Like 

* **Scalable, Reliable, Flexible** 

  - *Efficiently used resources*; from identifying them carefully, to caching and batching with thought 
  - *Is not static* and instead, after each agent completes a phase, there is no hesitation to add a phase or redo work, in fact it is expected  
  - *Subagents work in parallel* whenever possible, they always review their own work, and they also have someone provide feedback on their work  

### Advanced Workflow Features 

* **Agentic triggered autonomous workflows** 

  - Think of this as *setting an alarm for intelligence* to start working 
  - When triggered, Mao can analyze and optimize anything 
    - This is a great way to *reduce the need for human intervention*  and allow the tool to *constantly evolve* over time 
    - Mao will review analytics, find patterns, create workflows that take advantage of their findings 
    - You can do the same for your business, any reports, website maintenance, etc. 
  - In its simplest form, you can just *schedule Mao to work on the same thing every week, month, etc.*

* **Leave your workflow open-ended** 

  - There is no reason not to, when Mao is the one building and running the agents completing the workflow 
  - It creates a more natural human-like flow 
  - Agents and Mao and *respond to things in real-time*
