# MASTER_TASK_LIST Addition - Terminal UI Foundation

## Priority Level: POST-WALKTHROUGH (Do After #2 Walkthrough is Complete)

### Terminal UI System - Beautiful Interface for MAO

**Status:** Foundation prepared, awaiting walkthrough completion  
**Priority:** High (but only after walkthrough)  
**Complexity:** Medium-High integration task  

#### What We Have Ready:
- ✅ Terminal UI foundation files (app.py, styles.py, styles.css, main_menu.py)
- ✅ Professional color palette and styling system (Anthropic-inspired, no emojis)
- ✅ Navigation system architecture
- ✅ Integration specification for Claude Code
- ✅ Clear understanding of MAO codebase structure (from cursor audit)

#### What This Replaces:
- Current print-statement based `interfaces/ui_terminal.py`
- **IMPORTANT:** Print functions contain valuable UI requirements - these should be integrated into new UI, NOT discarded

#### Directory Structure to Create:
```
interfaces/
├── ui_terminal.py          # KEEP existing print functions - add beautiful UI option
├── ui_web.py              # (existing)
└── terminal/              # NEW - beautiful UI system
    ├── app.py             # Main terminal application
    ├── styles.py          # Professional color schemes
    ├── styles.css         # Textual CSS styling
    ├── navigation.py      # Navigation management
    ├── orchestrator_bridge.py # Direct integration with MAO core
    ├── workflow_bridge.py # UI to workflow execution
    ├── config_bridge.py   # Integration with configs/ system
    └── components/        # UI components
        ├── main_menu.py   # Main navigation
        ├── workflow_wizard.py # Workflow creation
        ├── workflow_manager.py # Workflow management  
        ├── command_runner.py # Execution interface
        ├── settings_screen.py # Configuration
        ├── base_widgets.py # Reusable components
        ├── progress_display.py # Progress tracking
        └── notification_system.py # Status messages
```

#### Foundation Files Ready to Copy:
1. `app.py` - Main terminal application (from "Complete Terminal Foundation" artifact)
2. `styles.py` - Color schemes and styling (from "Complete Terminal Foundation" artifact)  
3. `styles.css` - Textual CSS styling (from thread artifacts)
4. `navigation.py` - Navigation system (from "Complete Terminal Foundation" artifact)
5. `main_menu.py` - Main navigation component (from "Complete Terminal Foundation" artifact)

#### Setup Steps (When Ready):
1. **Create directory structure:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p interfaces/terminal/components
   touch interfaces/terminal/__init__.py
   touch interfaces/terminal/components/__init__.py
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install rich textual
   ```

3. **Copy foundation files** to `interfaces/terminal/` directory

4. **Modify ui_terminal.py** to offer both modes:
   ```python
   def main():
       import sys
       if "--ui" in sys.argv:
           from interfaces.terminal.app import MaoTerminalApp
           app = MaoTerminalApp()
           app.run()
       else:
           # Existing print-based interface
           launch_print_interface()
   ```

5. **Run integration in Claude Code** using integration spec

#### Integration Requirements:
- **Use existing print function content** as UI requirements (don't discard)
- **Direct integration** with orchestrator core (no print interception needed)
- **Preserve button snippet prints** (functional, keep unchanged)
- **Preserve demo prints** (examples, keep unchanged)
- **Use existing configs/** for model/provider management
- **Integrate with existing workflow patterns**

#### Key Architectural Decisions Made:
- **Professional aesthetic** - Clean, Anthropic-inspired, no emojis
- **Modular memory system** - workflow-specific memory.py in each use-case directory
- **Direct orchestrator calls** - UI calls core functions directly
- **Print function preservation** - Existing prints are UI requirements, not waste

#### Dependencies:
- Must complete walkthrough first (contains true holistic UI/UX planning)
- Requires integration spec (see spec comparison below)
- Needs clean MAO codebase structure (already audited with cursor)

#### Expected Outcome:
Beautiful, professional terminal interface that:
- Rivals Claude Code quality
- Integrates seamlessly with existing MAO functionality  
- Uses print function content as elegant UI components
- Provides smooth workflow creation, management, execution
- Maintains all existing functionality while enhancing UX

#### Notes:
- This is foundational work prepared during planning phase
- Implementation should wait for walkthrough completion
- Print functions contain valuable UI requirements - integrate, don't replace
- Foundation is solid but integration requires full context from walkthrough
